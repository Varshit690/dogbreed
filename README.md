🐶 Dog Breed Identification Using Transfer Learning
📌 Project Overview

The Dog Breed Identification using Transfer Learning project is a deep learning-based web application that classifies dog breeds from images.

This system uses the pre-trained VGG19 convolutional neural network model with ImageNet weights and applies transfer learning to classify dog images into multiple breed categories.

The trained model is integrated with a Flask web application, allowing users to upload an image and receive a predicted dog breed.
